This section demonstrates my professional communication skills through written communication and team collaboration.

## 📎 Evidence
## I have two examples that show my professional communication skills:
1. **Internship Application Email**  
  I wrote this formal email to apply for an IT internship at DataBalk company(9 October 2025). Attached my resume and highlighted my skills and interest professionally.

> Email Evidence:
This is a real email I sent to apply for a job. It shows I know how to write professionally to companies - using proper greetings, clear language, and professional closing. This is important because in the workplace, I'll need to email managers, clients, and other professionals.



3. **Minutes of Meetings**  
   Documented three team meetings (1 Aug, 12 Aug, 25 Aug 2025) where we discussed project setup, progress, challenges, and decisions using clear and structured communication.
