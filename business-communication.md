### **SITUATION** 
I needed to use professional communication in two different situations - applying for an internship with a company and working with my team on a a school project called kiddo health.

###  **TASK**
My goal was to show I can communicate professionally in different settings. For the email, I wanted to make a good impression on a potential employer. For the meeting minutes, I wanted to help my team stay organized and clear about our work.
