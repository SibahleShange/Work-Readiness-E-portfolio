I needed to apply what I learned in interview skills and demonstrate my ability to respond professionally and confidently.

**ACTION**  
I prepared my responses, practiced answering behavioral questions, and received constructive feedback from facilitators.

**RESULT**  
I improved my interview techniques, learned how to manage nerves, and developed clearer, more structured answers.
