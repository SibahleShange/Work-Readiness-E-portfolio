My goal was to master both the theoretical principles of workplace etiquette and their practical application in professional settings. I needed to understand professional communication protocols, team collaboration standards, and presentation etiquette, then demonstrate these skills effectively in a team presentation environment.

**ACTION**  
-  I studied workplace etiquette principles and achieved strong performance on the formal assessment, demonstrating understanding of professional communication, punctuality, confidentiality, and appropriate workplace behavior
-  I applied these principles during our IOT team presentation by maintaining professional communication, demonstrating confident presentation skills, and showing respect for both team members and the audience
-   I worked effectively with my team to prepare and deliver the presentation, ensuring we represented our project professionally while acknowledging everyone's contributions
  

**RESULT**  
Through this comprehensive approach to workplace etiquette, I have developed both proven theoretical knowledge and demonstrated practical skills that prepare me for professional environments. The assessment confirmed my understanding of essential workplace principles, while the IOT presentation showcased my ability to apply these etiquette standards in real-world situations. This experience has significantly enhanced my professional confidence in communicating and collaborating effectively within team settings, while also improving my presentation skills for delivering technical content to diverse audiences. Most importantly, I now feel genuinely prepared to contribute positively to workplace cultures, having gained a deep appreciation for respecting diverse perspectives and collaborating professionally to achieve common goals in software engineering environments..
