## üéØ My Reflection (STAR Technique)

### **SITUATION**  
As I prepared for entry-level software engineering interviews, I realized that simply knowing technical skills was not enough. I needed to demonstrate both my technical competence and my ability to communicate effectively with potential employers. Additionally, understanding the companies I was applying to was essential for tailoring my responses and showing genuine interest.

### **TASK**  
My goal was to create a documnent for interview preparation that combined practicing technical and behavioral questions and performing in-depth company research. I wanted to ensure that I could confidently present my skills, connect my experience to the companies‚Äô needs, and ask meaningful questions during interviews.

### **ACTION**  
#### To achieve this, I:
- Researched common technical and behavioral interview questions,applying the STAR technique to provide structured answers , real-life examples.
- Conducted detailed company research on Takealot, Amazon, Woolworths, and DataBalk to understand their tech stacks, values, culture, and growth opportunities.
- Prepared thoughtful questions tailored to each company, demonstrating both curiosity and industry awareness.  
- Practiced articulating my technical projects, such as **my Automated Traffic System**, to show practical experience relevant to their needs.

### **RESULT** 
#### Through this process, I:
- I gained confidence in answering interview questions and presenting my skills  
- Learned to tell specific, structured stories that highlight my problem-solving, teamwork, and technical abilities
- Understood that interviews are two-way conversations, where evaluating company culture and growth opportunities is just as important as presenting myself.
- Recognized the value of preparation and research, which reduces anxiety, improves focus, and allows me to respond to questions thoughtfully.

### **Overall Reflection:**  
The evidence from my Interview Questions Preparation and Company Research demonstrates that effective preparation is not just about memorizing answers. It is about understanding the context of the company, aligning my skills to their needs, and practicing structured communication. This experience has strengthened both my technical and professional confidence, preparing me to make a strong impression in interviews and future software engineering roles.
